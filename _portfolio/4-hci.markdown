<i>Illustration, Web Design</i>

For the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Waterloo, I designed the Augmented Intelligence Lab's website, currently being developed. The website is meant to be an informative source, highlighting team members, news and publications surrounding the lab, and to recruit researchers and collaborators. I designed a simple website to help bring their vision to life.

My favourite part of this project was designing a compelling splash page illustration to bring visual interest to the website and highlight elements of curiousity, play, and learning.
