<i>Creative Direction, Illustration, Print Design</i>

During my time on the <strong>Ads Platform</strong> team at <strong>Facebook</strong> (now known as Meta), I enjoyed contributing to internal culture initiatives by working with cross-functional partners in designing swag, posters, and presentation decks for various org-wide events. I love seeing my designs come to life in physical form. Here are a few samples below.

<h3> Fix-A-Thon </h3>
I was on the Fix-A-Thon organizing committee: a team-wide “hackathon” over two days per quarter where teams focus on fixing UX and performance bugs. These events focus on improving Ads Platform quality. The event involves competition and prizes for teams that can fix the most bugs.

<h3> Make Every Impression Meaningful </h3>
I designed these stickers which were handed out during a biannual org-wide presentation event, highlighting our mission, celebrating our wins, and sharing top-level projects.
