<p>I designed this custom card deck as part of the swag package for over 1,000 hackathon attendees. I had a ton of fun concepting and ideating the face cards. My favourite is the Queen, wearing a VR headset. Themes of binary trees, Java and Python puns, and a VR-headset-wearing queen can be found in the deck.</p>
