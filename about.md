Hi there! My name is Helga and I'm a designer with a technical background passionate about building intuitive, functional, and beautiful interfaces.
<br/>

I not only love the craft of creating delightful interfaces, but ones that solve the userâ€™s problems, not complicate them. I believe in putting users first and shipping meaningful experiences.

When I'm not designing, I run a <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/puddingfishcakes" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> featuring polymer clay and DIY tutorials and <a class="link" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21944928-clay-charm-magic" target="_blank">wrote a book</a> about it too!
<br/>
<br/>
Check out my <a class="link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio">portfolio</a> and <a class="link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume.pdf" target="_blank">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.
