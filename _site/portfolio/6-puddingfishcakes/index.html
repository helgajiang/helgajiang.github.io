    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/puddingfishcakes" alt="PuddingFishCakes on YouTube">PuddingFishCakes is a YouTube channel</a> dedicated to the craft of polymer clay sculpting, featuring over 100 tutorials and craft projects. The channel has organically grown a 270,000+ subscriber audience with over 24 million video views to date. I wear many hats, including filming, photographing, video editing, Etsy-selling, social-media posting, designing, and of course, polymer clay sculpting.</p>

<p>The channel started as a creative outlet for me back in 2011. I’ve always gravitated towards anything small and cute, and loved to bring things to life. I soon became obsessed with polymer clay and joined a small community on YouTube for sculptors.</p>

<p>Since then, that community has grown to numbers I could have never imagined. I’ve even been lucky enough to work with and produce content for many companies and organizations, most recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DreamworksAnimation">DreamWorksTV</a>, reaching a 1.5 million subscriber audience. 
Other notable collaborations include <a href="https://gemr.com/">Gemr</a>, <a href="https://takeandmake.co/">Take&amp;Make</a>, and <a href="http://www.aminoapps.com/get/crafty/">Amino Apps</a>.</p>

<p>I also wrote a <a href="http://amzn.to/1SmuwjR" alt="Clay Charm Magic!">children’s craft book</a> on polymer clay projects, available in major bookstores across North America.

<!--The logo was made from sketches in notebooks and later vectorized into Adobe Illustrator. The downfall with the name is that it’s quite long (too long for a <a href="https://twitter.com/pfishcakes">twitter handle</a>, in fact!) so instead of keeping all 16 characters, I just kept the initials to keep it as simple as possible. I also illustrated some vector icons for my channel banner.-->

<!--I went with a more organic, flowy, hand-drawn look, since PuddingFishCakes is all about making things with your hands. What’s really amazing is that even though someone could recreate clay projects using my tutorials, each maker’s style will still persist in his or her creations and thus every clay piece turns out unique to the artist!-->
