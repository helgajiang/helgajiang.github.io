<a href="https://hackthenorth.com/" target="_blank">Hack the North</a> is Canada's biggest hackathon where anyone can spark their passion for building and creating. On the organizing committee, I designed this custom card deck as part of the swag package for over 1,000 hackathon attendees.

I enjoyed concepting and ideating various elements of the cards: themes of binary trees, Java and Python puns, and a VR-headset-wearing queen are a few of the quirky details that can be found in the deck. Our team corresponded with a third-party vendor to print the deck.</div>

In addition to designing swag items, I also collaborated with the organizing team to produce the welcome booklet, which detailed the event schedule, sponsors, venue map, and workshops.</div>
