I"¯<p><i>Illustration, Web Design</i></p>

<p>For the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Waterloo, I designed the Augmented Intelligence Labâ€™s website, currently being developed. The website is meant to be an informative source, highlighting team members, news and publications surrounding the lab, and to recruit researchers and collaborators. I produced a simple website to help bring their vision to life.</p>

My favourite part of this project was designing a compelling splash page illustration to bring visual interest to the website and highlight elements of curiousity, play, and learning.
