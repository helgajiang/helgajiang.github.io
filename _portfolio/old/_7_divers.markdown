Role: Designer and Front End Developer
<br/>

Divers4Oceanography is a crowdsourcing citizen science project that collects ocean temperatures from divers around the world to be made available to scientists and researchers who work in marine biology, fisheries, conservation, and climate change. Learn more about the project <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/v2/viewArticle/preview.do?id=227889">here</a>.

This was one of the design projects I took on during my time in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at University of Waterloo. I was responsible for designing and building the first prototype.

Tools used: Sketch, HTML, CSS (including <a href="http://materializecss.com/">MaterializeCSS</a>), and Javascript.

Here are the resulting mockups:
