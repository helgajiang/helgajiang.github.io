Hi there! My name is Helga and I'm a designer with a technical background passionate about building intuitive, functional, and beautiful interfaces.
<br/>

I have a formal background in Computer Science, but I love design — not only the craft of building delightful interfaces, but ones that solve the user’s problems, not complicate them. I believe in putting users first and shipping meaningful experiences.

When I'm not designing, I run a <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/puddingfishcakes" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> dedicated to the craft of polymer clay sculpting and <a class="link" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21944928-clay-charm-magic" target="_blank">wrote a book</a> about it too!
<br/>
