<p>I designed this custom card deck as part of the swag package for over 1,000 hackathon attendees. I had a ton of fun concepting and ideating the face cards. My favourite is the Queen, wearing a VR headset. Themes of binary trees, java and python puns, and a VR-headset-wearing queen are some of the fun elements in the deck.</p>

<p>(Other responsibilities included: event signage, sticker illustration, social media assets)</p>
