<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These thoughts are my own and do not necessarily represent those of Facebook (Meta).

During my time at Facebook (now known as Meta), I had the opportunity to work alongside a stellar team of product and content designers and engineers. With the support of data science, user research, product management, and org directors, we build a design system for our recommendation products. This effort materialized into a set of guidelines, UI elements, customized components, and a step-by-step framework of building a recommendation.

<h3>The Process</h3>

<ol>
<li>Alignment on problem space, prioritization, goals, success metrics, deliverables</li>
<li>Design sprint</li>
<li>Feedback rounds and refinement</li>
<li>Usability research</li>
<li>Share-out and deliver</li>
<li>Track implementation and roll-out</li>
</ol>


Designing the system required context-sharing, cross-org collaboration between my team, Delivery Intelligence, and the Ads Manager platform team. It involved multi-day workshops and design sprints. Some collaboration highlights:

<ul>

<li>Took charge in preparing presentations and leading the team through multiple reviews</li>
<li>Regularly set agendas, provided updates, and led discussions in weekly XFN meetings to align and unblock the team efficiently</li>
<li>Developed a share-out plan, which laid the foundation for building the microsite and writing accompanying notes. These resources increased visibility of our work for broader teams</li>
<li>Main point of contact with the UX research team when developing the research plan for the framework; worked with the team to develop and align on questions to be answered, communicated between team members to make sure everyone was heard, prepared prototypes, and supported RES throughout the process</li>
</ul>

Throughout the design process, I rapidly iterated to present multiple solutions to the team, solicited feedback from different forums (crit, reviews, etc), reviewed other team members’ designs to influence quality and identify risks, and referred to research whenever possible. When existing design components were proven to not be sufficient for our use cases, I explored and pioneered new ones. 


<h3>Design Details</h3>

We developed a set of guidelines, defined high-level flows, and developed reusable components. Details were built into an internal microsite with accompanying company-wide notes for visibility and for other teams to refer to.
We also updated all 5 existing recommendation flows to the new framework, which are now live.

Among other components, I designed and pioneered a unique UI solution for recommendation cards that live in the Ads Manager table. This saw a stat-sig increase in user retention. See below for details.

<h3>The Results</h3>
We saw a significant increase in productivity with developing and designing new recommendations into the Ads Manager platform.
