I"Ë<p>During my time on the Ads Platform team at Facebook (now known as Meta), I enjoyed contributing to internal culture initiatives by working with cross-functional partners in designing swag, posters, and presentation decks for org-wide events. I love seeing my designs come to life in physical form. Here are a few samples below.</p>
