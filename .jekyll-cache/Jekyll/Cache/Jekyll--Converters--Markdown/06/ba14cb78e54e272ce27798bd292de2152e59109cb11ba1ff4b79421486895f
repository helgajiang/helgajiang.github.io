<p><a href="https://hackthenorth.com/" target="_blank">Hack the North</a> is Canadaâ€™s biggest hackathon where anyone can spark their passion for building and creating. As part of the organizing team, I designed this custom card deck as part of the swag package for over 1,000 hackathon attendees. I enjoyed concepting and ideating various elements of the cards; themes of binary trees, Java and Python puns, and a VR-headset-wearing queen are some of the elements that can be found in the deck.</p>
