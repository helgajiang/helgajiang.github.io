I"{<p>During my time on the Ads Platform team at Facebook (now known as Meta), I enjoyed contributing to internal culture initiatives by working with cross-functional partners in designing swag, posters, and presentation decks for org-wide events. I love seeing my designs come to life in physical form. Here are a few samples below.</p>

I was on the Fix-A-Thon organizing committee: a team-wide “hackathon” over two days per quarter where teams focus on fixing UX and performance bugs. These events focus on improving Ads Platform quality. The event involves camaraderie and prizes in seeing which team can fix the most bugs. These are posters I designed to help announce and raise awareness to rally teams for participation.
